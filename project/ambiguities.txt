Section: 2.1
Problem: The project description did not specify whether the ficticious language
has support for nested function declarations. 

Therefore, I decided that strings
with nested functions are not a part of the Context Free Language generated by
my grammar, similarly to standard C.

Paragraph: 13
Problem: The project description did not explicitly state whether the body of a user
defined type declaration can be empty. 

Therefore, I made the decision that 
empty user defined type declarations are not syntactically acceptable.
